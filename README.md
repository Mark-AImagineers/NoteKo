# 📝 NoteKo

**NoteKo** is my personal note-taking app — built as a sandbox to sharpen my full-stack dev skills while creating a tool that actually helps me think, remember, and grow.

This isn’t meant to be a commercial product (at least for now). It’s a personal system I’m building to level up my skills in:

- Frontend development with **React**
- Backend development with **FastAPI** and **Python**
- Containerization and deployment using **Docker**
- Working with both **structured (PostgreSQL)** and **unstructured (MongoDB)** data
- Exploring how to deploy it like a standard Windows app (EXE-style), or a portable local app
- Building a **mobile app** version for cross-device sync
- Hosting everything through a **home server setup**

The big picture: to create a digital companion that grows with me — something like Tony Stark’s personal tools, but practical, minimal, and mine.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React + JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **Database (Structured)**: PostgreSQL
- **Database (Unstructured)**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Mobile App**: Possibly React Native or Flutter
- **Sync & Hosting**: Self-hosted home server (future phase)

---

## 🚀 Future Trajectory

- Build local-only MVP, containerized via Docker
- Implement dual-database setup (Postgres + MongoDB)
- Add sync support across devices
- Build mobile app for on-the-go access
- Deploy and manage via home server
- Explore app bundling for desktop (EXE, AppImage, etc.)
- Long-term: experiment with AI features (summarization, Q&A, smart tagging)

> A raw log of decisions, ideas, frustrations, and wins. Helps me track progress and thought processes.

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` *Started sketching out how note objects should look. Might separate longform notes vs. flash-style notes.*
> This isn’t just an app — it’s my lab. My sandbox. My system. Built to grow with me.
